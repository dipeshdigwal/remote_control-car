# remote_control-car

Hello friends.
This project was a part of a inter-hostel competition within my college ,i.e, IIT GUWAHATI. This project is simply a remote controlled car for which we used materials like:
  arduino uno
  hc-05 bluetooth module
  servo motor
  500 rpm dc motor
  joystick module
  jumpers
Function of this project model was to take data from a joystick module connected to a arduino uno.Use this data to be transmitted by bluetooth module connected with the arduino uno in wired way and recieve the value off joystick using a bluetooth module connected in wired way with a arduino uno placed on our car with attached servo motor and dc motors.
At the reciever end our work was to process the output value from joystick(i.e. transmitted from remote's end) to controll actuators(i.e. servo motor and dc motors) accordingly.
